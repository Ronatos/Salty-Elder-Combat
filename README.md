# Salty Elder Combat

~~The name is a stand-in. We don't know what to call this yet.~~
This game is most definitely about angry old people fighting.

## Combat

Combat is the main gameplay loop, so we'll start with this.

- Use D&D 5e as a platform to start with, and customize from there.
- Combat will be text based
- It should feel like a give and take strategy game as you swipe at your opponent and move to block their attacks.
- Different parts of the body should be targetable
- Counter attacks and critical hits should be available
- Weapon type matters, elemental effects should come in to play, weaknesses and strengths should be involved, armor covering different parts of the body should matter, different material of armor should matter.. etc.
- Equipment upgrades will probably be a big part of the gameplay loop.
- The body target zones will be numbered as follows; 1 = head, 2 = right arm and side, 3 = left arm and side, 4 = back, 5 = right leg, 6 = left leg

### Melee

I want melee to be a strategic dance, where each individual is trying to outsmart and outmaneuver the other. I want combat to be approachable as a newcomer, but with a rewarding, high skill ceiling if the player chooses to reach for it.

### Melee Fighting Styles

I'm taking a lot of inspiration from Star Wars lightsaber styles. https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber_combat/Legends

1. **Form I: Shii-Cho**

The first and most basic of the seven forms of sword combat, Shii-Cho is often used as a training form, with almost everyone receiving some instruction in it. Basic initiates in the style demonstrate rather clumsy performance, though in the hands of a master, Shii-Cho is fluid, highly randomized, and unpredictable.

Shii-Cho is considered an effective fall-back option when no other form or combat style will do. Form I combat is wild and raw, relying on deliberate tactics and being primarily aimed towards disarming rather than injuring foes. Form I encourages deliberate tactics, calling for continuous, step-by-step advancement while cutting off the opponent's angles.

Shii-Cho is specialized towards engaging multiple opponents, the wide, sweeping motions being ideally suited towards attacking numerous adversaries. However, Form I is not as useful against single opponents, as such enemies have greater mobility and can find a weakness in Shii-Cho's comparatively clumsy bladework.

**Disarming Slash**

A strike directed at the opponent's weapon in an attempt to rip it out of their grasp or destroy it.

**Sarlacc Sweep**

A wide sweeping attack in which the duelist strikes multiple enemies.

### Ranged

As someone who very much enjoys ranged combat (bows, crossbows, javelins, throwing axes) in many games, I want to do this fighting style justice by making it as fun and engaging as the other styles. Needs more thought.

### Magic

I want magic to be an active skill, with patterns and combinations that the player must remember in order to execute properly. It shouldn't be enough that the player's character remembers how to cast spells. That's boring. The player should as well, and be rewarded with more powerful and impressive abilities as a result of their devotion to their practice.

## UI

When creating text-based games, the UI is always the biggest pain point for me. I want to keep this accessible to casual players, but complex enough for gamers that care about strategy. Playing the game should be the focus, not learning the UI.

- Menu based gameplay, with some text entry
- Text entry on the bottom. Just above it will be a scrolling box of log history.
- Buttons and menus should have a place if they're needed.

## Graphics

Graphics will be considered optional if we complete the game and see an opportunity to improve the game with them.

## Adventure

We haven't decided what the "overworld" will look like, or if exploration will also be text based.

- Game will likely be solo only, but multiplayer is a consideration
- Start out with essentially nothing, and build yourself up from the bootstraps to become and epic warrior.
- 1 vs many is still unclear mechanically
