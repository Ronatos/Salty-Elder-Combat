# Salty Elder Combat

The name is a stand-in. We don't know what to call this yet.

## Combat

Combat is the main gameplay loop, so we'll start with this.

- Use D&D 5e as a platform to start with, and customize from there.
- Combat will be text based
- It should feel like a give and take strategy game as you swipe at your opponent and move to block their attacks.
- Different parts of the body should be targetable
- Counter attacks and critical hits should be available
- Weapon type matters, elemental effects should come in to play, weaknesses and strengths should be involved, armor covering different parts of the body should matter, different material of armor should matter.. etc.
- Equipment upgrades will probably be a big part of the gameplay loop.

## UI

When creating text-based games, the UI is always the biggest pain point for me. I want to keep this accessible to casual players, but complex enough for gamers that care about strategy. Playing the game should be the focus, not learning the UI.

- Menu based gameplay, with some text entry
- Text entry on the bottom. Just above it will be a scrolling box of log history.
- Buttons and menus should have a place if they're needed.

## Graphics

Graphics will be considered optional if we complete the game and see an opportunity to improve the game with them.

## Adventure

We haven't decided what the "overworld" will look like, or if exploration will also be text based.

- Game will likely be solo only, but multiplayer is a consideration
- Start out with essentially nothing, and build yourself up from the bootstraps to become and epic warrior.
- 1 vs many is still unclear mechanically
