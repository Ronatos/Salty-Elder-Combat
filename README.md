# Salty Elder Combat

~~The name is a stand-in. We don't know what to call this yet.~~
~~This game is most definitely about angry old people fighting.~~
We'll see.

## Combat

Combat is the main gameplay loop, so we'll start with this.

- Use D&D 5e as a platform to start with, and customize from there.
- Combat will be text based
- It should feel like a give and take strategy game as you swipe at your opponent and move to block their attacks.
- Different parts of the body should be targetable
- Counter attacks and critical hits should be available
- Weapon type matters, elemental effects should come in to play, weaknesses and strengths should be involved, armor covering different parts of the body should matter, different material of armor should matter.. etc.
- Equipment upgrades will probably be a big part of the gameplay loop.
- The body target zones will be numbered as follows; 1 = head, 2 = right arm and side, 3 = left arm and side, 4 = back, 5 = right leg, 6 = left leg

### Melee

I want melee to be a strategic dance, where each individual is trying to outsmart and outmaneuver the other. I want combat to be approachable as a newcomer, but with a rewarding, high skill ceiling if the player chooses to reach for it.

I have mixed feelings about the maneuevers section. Those are being carried over from the source, but aren't necessarily going to be used.

### Melee Fighting Styles

Each melee fighting style has strengths and weaknesses. The player will begin the game without knowing any fighting styles, and can learn new styles from a trainer of that style. Once a style is known, it may be switched to in combat at will, provided the user is trained in that particular style with the equipped weapon. Each style will improve with usage independently.

For example, if I were using a katana at the beginning of the game, I would not know any fighting styles, but still be able to use the katana to some limited effectiveness. Once I find a trainer that will teach me a particular style, I will have unlocked that fighting style to be used with all weapons; however, my proficiency with that style will then be tied to the weapon I am using. Twenty years down the road, I may have levelled up in Form I using the katana a great deal.. but if it's my first time using an axe with a shield, I will be starting at level 1 in Form 1 with the axe and shield. I may be high levelled in general and know a fighting style, but with the axe & shield, my technique could really use some work.

I'm taking a lot of inspiration from Star Wars lightsaber styles. https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber_combat/Legends

1. **Form I: Shii-Cho**

**What is it?**
The first and most basic of the seven forms of sword combat, Shii-Cho is often used as a training form, with almost everyone receiving some instruction in it. Form I encourages deliberate tactics, calling for continuous, step-by-step advancement while cutting off the opponent's angles. Basic initiates in the style demonstrate rather clumsy performance, though in the hands of a master, Shii-Cho is fluid, highly randomized, and unpredictable.

**When should it be used?**
Shii-Cho is considered an effective fall-back option when no other form or combat style will do. Form I combat is wild and raw, relying on deliberate tactics and being primarily aimed towards disarming rather than injuring foes. Shii-Cho is specialized towards engaging multiple opponents, the wide, sweeping motions being ideally suited towards attacking numerous adversaries.

**When should it not be used?**
Form I is not as useful against single opponents - especially those using Form II, as such enemies have greater mobility and can find a weakness in Shii-Cho's comparatively clumsy bladework.

**Strengths**
- Effective against groups of opponents.
- Effective at disarming opponents.
- Easy to learn
- Good all around
- Usable by any character build effectively

**Weaknesses**
- Ineffective against singular opponents.
- Easily countered by Form II

**Maneuvers**
- *Disarming Slash*: 
A strike directed at the opponent's weapon in an attempt to rip it out of their grasp or destroy it.
- *Sarlacc Sweep*: 
A wide sweeping attack in which the combatant strikes multiple enemies.

2. **Form II: Makashi**

**What is it?**
Form II is the second of the seven forms of sword combat. Relying on precision and efficiency over Shii-Cho's wild, sweeping motions, Form II allowed an initiate to defend themselves against an opponent with minimal effort, while placing a heavy focus on avoiding disarmament. Makashi is described as elegant and focused, and is based on balance and footwork to outmaneuver opponents. Fluidity, precision, and economy of motion are relied on, rather than strength, with Form II bladework heavily utilizing jabs and light cuts rather than hack and slash movements. Practitioners or Form II rely on feints to confuse and trap opponents, and place a great deal of emphasis on footwork in both attack and defense. The footwork of Form II practitioners commonly follows a single line, front and back, shifting the feet to keep in perfect balance as the practitioner advances and retreats. Makashi is a style based on balance, on back-and-forth charges, thrusts, and sudden retreats.

**When should it be used?**
The form is at its fore when engaged in combat against a single enemy duelist. Makashi practitioners are also uncommonly adept at defending themselves from magical attacks, as the blade is often wielded in one hand. This allows for offhand equipment or magic to be used.

**When should it not be used?**
As Makashi is designed strictly for blade-to-blade combat, it lacks an effective means of combating enemies with projectile weapons. The greatest flaw of the Makashi system of combat is its inability to generate kinetic energy in its application; the focus on precision and blade control hampers an adherent's ability to generate momentum in both offensive and defensive maneuvers. This means that a duelist who possesses a sufficient level of physical strength could potentially overwhelm a Makashi practitioner, shunting aside strikes from the form's precision offense and simply bashing through it's evasive, footwork-oriented defense. This lack of physical force leaves Makashi practitioners vulnerable to duelists utilizing more contemporary forms, which emphasize power and brute strength. This weakness is especially pronounced against practitioners of the Djem So variant of Form V, as the style is based almost entirely around fast, strength-oriented swordplay. This weakness can, to varying degrees, be compensated for with rigorous strength training or augmentation of some kind.

**Strengths**
- Counters Form I
- Effective against singular opponents
- Allows for flexibility against magic-users
- Effective style for dexterous characters
- Combat maneuver stamina cost is reduced

**Weaknesses**
- Countered by overwhelming strength
- Weak to projectiles

**Maneuvers**
- *Contentious Opportunity*: 
A tactic based upon recognizing and exploiting an opening in the opponent's defense before swiftly moving to strike the exposed enemy.
- *Makashi Riposte*: 
A defensive technique where the duelist slightly alters the angle of an opponent's attack before quickly retaliating with a counter strike.

3. **Form III: Soresu**

https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Form_III/Legends

**What is it?**
Form III is the third of the seven forms of sword combat. Like Makashi, Soresu relies on economy of motion and energy efficiency, keeping up constant blade movement to build up momentum and minimize energy expenditure. Form III focuses on strong defensive technique to essentially outlast an opponent, waiting until he/she begins making mistakes due to frustration or fatigue, before taking advantage of these lapses and countering. The Soresu form was devised to provide a duelist a defense against projectile weapons, weapons that the Makashi form isn't equipped to combat. Form III involves preparation for prolonged battles where the user observes and learns as much as possible about their adversary's technique while engaged in combat.

**When should it be used?**
The pragmatic Form III is the most defensive of the seven forms, and utilizes tight moves, consisting of subtle dodges and efficient parries, intended to provide maximum defensive coverage, and minimize exposure to ranged fire. This technique minimizes the body's exposure, making a well-trained practitioner practically invincible, which allowes Soresu to be effective against both single enemies and multiple opponents, as well as blasters and swords. Also, being more optimized for lengthy battles, a Soresu user has the ability to gain control of a combat situation, creating multiple options for the user employing the form. A Form III user can choose to kill, disarm, or even reason with their opponent.

**When should it not be used?**
Form III facilitates survival rather than victory, as Soresu possesses no dedicated offensive sequences of its own. Form III initiates are more than capable of defending themselves from attack, but they need considerable experience to effectively counterattack and entrap opponents. Masters maintain an incredibly strong focus on the center of the combat circle, since the defensive tactics of the form include guards and parries that engage very close to the body. Combatants with small lapses in their otherwise strong defense leave little room to avoid injury. As a result of this defensive mindset, Soresu practitioners often have great difficulty seizing the offensive initiative in combat. Also, the goal of many Soresu practitioners is to prolong the fight, the idea being to cause the enemy to become fatigued or frustrated as they attempt to keep up their offense. However, this tactic runs the risk of fatiguing the user if said user faces an adversary who can maintain an aggressive but cautious offense.

**Strengths**
- Very strong defense
- Effective against projectiles and swords
- Defensive maneuvers consume greatly reduced stamina
- Good against both singular and multiple opponents
- More prolonged fights can lead to fewer lethal encounters

**Weaknesses**
- Few offensive capabilities

**Maneuevers**
- *Circle of Shelter*: 
A technique where the duelist creates a protected area around themselves and their allies, making it difficult for enemies to penetrate.
- *Deflecting Slash*: 
A technique where the duelist redirects the momentum generated by deflecting an enemy projectile into a slashing attack at an adjacent target.

### Ranged

As someone who very much enjoys ranged combat (bows, crossbows, javelins, throwing axes) in many games, I want to do this fighting style justice by making it as fun and engaging as the other styles. Needs more thought.

### Magic

I want magic to be an active skill, with patterns and combinations that the player must remember in order to execute properly. It shouldn't be enough that the player's character remembers how to cast spells. That's boring. The player should as well, and be rewarded with more powerful and impressive abilities as a result of their devotion to their practice.

## UI

When creating text-based games, the UI is always the biggest pain point for me. I want to keep this accessible to casual players, but complex enough for gamers that care about strategy. Playing the game should be the focus, not learning the UI.

- Menu based gameplay, with some text entry
- Text entry on the bottom. Just above it will be a scrolling box of log history.
- Buttons and menus should have a place if they're needed.

## Graphics

Graphics will be considered optional if we complete the game and see an opportunity to improve the game with them.

## Adventure

We haven't decided what the "overworld" will look like, or if exploration will also be text based.

- Game will likely be solo only, but multiplayer is a consideration
- Start out with essentially nothing, and build yourself up from the bootstraps to become and epic warrior.
- 1 vs many is still unclear mechanically
