# Salty Elder Combat

~~The name is a stand-in. We don't know what to call this yet.~~
~~This game is most definitely about angry old people fighting.~~
We'll see.

## Combat

Combat is the main gameplay loop, so we'll start with this.

- Use D&D 5e as a platform to start with, and customize from there.
- Combat will be text based
- It should feel like a give and take strategy game as you swipe at your opponent and move to block their attacks.
- Different parts of the body should be targetable
- Counter attacks and critical hits should be available
- Weapon type matters, elemental effects should come in to play, weaknesses and strengths should be involved, armor covering different parts of the body should matter, different material of armor should matter.. etc.
- Equipment upgrades will probably be a big part of the gameplay loop.
- The body target zones will be numbered as follows; 1 = head, 2 = right arm and side, 3 = left arm and side, 4 = back, 5 = right leg, 6 = left leg

### Melee

I want melee to be a strategic dance, where each individual is trying to outsmart and outmaneuver the other. I want combat to be approachable as a newcomer, but with a rewarding, high skill ceiling if the player chooses to reach for it.

### Melee Fighting Styles

Each melee fighting style has strengths and weaknesses. The player will begin the game knowing Form I, and can learn new styles from a trainer of that style. Once a style is known, it may be switched to in combat at will. Each style will improve with usage independently.
I'm taking a lot of inspiration from Star Wars lightsaber styles. https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber_combat/Legends

1. **Form I: Shii-Cho**

**What is it?**
The first and most basic of the seven forms of sword combat, Shii-Cho is often used as a training form, with almost everyone receiving some instruction in it. Form I encourages deliberate tactics, calling for continuous, step-by-step advancement while cutting off the opponent's angles. Basic initiates in the style demonstrate rather clumsy performance, though in the hands of a master, Shii-Cho is fluid, highly randomized, and unpredictable.

**When should it be used?**
Shii-Cho is considered an effective fall-back option when no other form or combat style will do. Form I combat is wild and raw, relying on deliberate tactics and being primarily aimed towards disarming rather than injuring foes. Shii-Cho is specialized towards engaging multiple opponents, the wide, sweeping motions being ideally suited towards attacking numerous adversaries.

**When should it not be used?**
Form I is not as useful against single opponents - especially those using Form II, as such enemies have greater mobility and can find a weakness in Shii-Cho's comparatively clumsy bladework.

**Strengths**
- Effective against groups of opponents.
- Effective at disarming opponents.
- Easy to learn
- Good all around
- Usable by any character build effectively

**Weaknesses**
- Ineffective against singular opponents.
- Easily countered by Form II

**Maneuvers**
- *Disarming Slash*: 
A strike directed at the opponent's weapon in an attempt to rip it out of their grasp or destroy it.
- *Sarlacc Sweep*: 
A wide sweeping attack in which the combatant strikes multiple enemies.

2. **Form II: Makashi**

**What is it?**
Form II is the second of the seven forms of sword combat. Relying on precision and efficiency over Shii-Cho's wild, sweeping motions, Form II allowed an initiate to defend themselves against an opponent with minimal effort, while placing a heavy focus on avoiding disarmament. Makashi is described as elegant and focused, and is based on balance and footwork to outmaneuver opponents. Fluidity, precision, and economy of motion are relied on, rather than strength, with Form II bladework heavily utilizing jabs and light cuts rather than hack and slash movements. Practitioners or Form II rely on feints to confuse and trap opponents, and place a great deal of emphasis on footwork in both attack and defense. The footwork of Form II practitioners commonly follows a single line, front and back, shifting the feet to keep in perfect balance as the practitioner advances and retreats. Makashi is a style based on balance, on back-and-forth charges, thrusts, and sudden retreats.

**When should it be used?**
The form is at its fore when engaged in combat against a single enemy duelist. Makashi practitioners are also uncommonly adept at defending themselves from magical attacks, as the blade is wielded in one hand. This allows for offhand equipment or magic to be used.

**When should it not be used?**
As Makashi is designed strictly for blade-to-blade combat, it lacks an effective means of combating enemies with projectile weapons. The greatest flaw of the Makashi system of combat is its inability to generate kinetic energy in its application; the focus on precision and blade control hampers an adherent's ability to generate momentum in both offensive and defensive maneuvers. This means that a duelist who possesses a sufficient level of physical strength could potentially overwhelm a Makashi practitioner, shunting aside strikes from the form's precision offense and simply bashing through it's evasive, footwork-oriented defense. This lack of physical force leaves Makashi practitioners vulnerable to duelists utilizing more contemporary forms, which emphasize power and brute strength. This weakness is especially pronounced against practitioners of the Djem So variant of Form V, as the style is based almost entirely around fast, strength-oriented swordplay. This weakness can, to varying degrees, be compensated for with rigorous strength training or augmentation of some kind.

**Strengths**
- Counters Form I
- Effective against singular opponents
- Allows for flexibility against magic-users
- Effective style for dexterous characters

**Weaknesses**
- Countered by overwhelming strength
- Weak to projectiles

**Maneuvers**
- *Contentious Opportunity*: 
A tactic based upon recognizing and exploiting an opening in the opponent's defense before swiftly moving to strike the exposed enemy.
- *Makashi Riposte*: 
A defensive technique where the duelist slightly alters the angle of an opponent's attack before quickly retaliating with a counter strike.

### Ranged

As someone who very much enjoys ranged combat (bows, crossbows, javelins, throwing axes) in many games, I want to do this fighting style justice by making it as fun and engaging as the other styles. Needs more thought.

### Magic

I want magic to be an active skill, with patterns and combinations that the player must remember in order to execute properly. It shouldn't be enough that the player's character remembers how to cast spells. That's boring. The player should as well, and be rewarded with more powerful and impressive abilities as a result of their devotion to their practice.

## UI

When creating text-based games, the UI is always the biggest pain point for me. I want to keep this accessible to casual players, but complex enough for gamers that care about strategy. Playing the game should be the focus, not learning the UI.

- Menu based gameplay, with some text entry
- Text entry on the bottom. Just above it will be a scrolling box of log history.
- Buttons and menus should have a place if they're needed.

## Graphics

Graphics will be considered optional if we complete the game and see an opportunity to improve the game with them.

## Adventure

We haven't decided what the "overworld" will look like, or if exploration will also be text based.

- Game will likely be solo only, but multiplayer is a consideration
- Start out with essentially nothing, and build yourself up from the bootstraps to become and epic warrior.
- 1 vs many is still unclear mechanically
